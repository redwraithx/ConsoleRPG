# ConsoleRPG
 The first game I have made using C++, its a Dungeons and Dragons Style game.

- more changes planned but this is just something i'm doing as i learn more C++.
- restructuring and minimizing on repeating code
- more input sanitizing to avoid issues
- more Armors and weapons
- more spells
- maybe a map or at least a set locations for towns or static events at locations perhaps.
- cmake to make setting this up easier on everyone, something I have yet to try doing.

sorry no cmake file at this time I will get to it!
